# Vukky's Userscripts

Hello! Welcome to my magical list of userscripts that I have created!

Some of these can improve your experience (vast-ly ðŸ˜›) while others are just... well, dumb.

## Prerequisites

To use these, you will need to install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net).

Once you have done so, click the "install" links at the bottom to install any scripts you are interested in.

## Available scripts

* Vukkyfy ([install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vukkyy/userscripts/main/vastaisaladinator.user.js)) - VUKKIES EVERYWHERE!!!!!
* Skribbl+ ([install](https://github.com/Vukky123/userscripts/raw/main/skribbl/skribblplus.user.js)) - Enhance your Skribbl.io experience!
* Vast.ai Saladinator ([install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vukkyy/userscripts/main/vastaisaladinator.user.js)) - Improves vast.ai for usage with salad.com.

There are also various others that are not documented here, usually because they aren't ready or are no longer functional.
