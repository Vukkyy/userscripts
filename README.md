# Vukky's Userscripts

Hello! Welcome to my magical list of userscripts that I have created!

Some of these can improve your experience while others are just... well, dumb.

## Prerequisites

To use these, you will need to install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net).

Once you have done so, click the "install" links at the bottom to install any scripts you are interested in.

## Available scripts

* ArchiveTeam Tweaks ([install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vukkyy/userscripts/main/archiveteamtweaks.user.js)) - Improves the ArchiveTeam Warrior web interface.
* Vukkyfy ([install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vukkyy/userscripts/main/vukkyfy.user.js)) - VUKKIES EVERYWHERE!!!!!

* Pokéfarm Tweaks ([install](https://github.com/Vukky123/userscripts/raw/main/pokefarmtweaks.user.js)) - Sound effects for Pokéfarm Q!

There are also various others that are not documented here, usually because they aren't ready or are no longer functional.
